Hi, I'm Edd. I work as a technical program management leader inside
GitHub. I work primarily on Copilot, and security. I still get to mess
around with code in my spare time, where Clojure and Rust are my footguns
of choice.

### Me and open source

My journey in open source started some time before GitHub existed, so
you're unlikely to find too much in the contribution graphs: most of
my coding stopped around ten years ago, and I contribute in other ways
these days. The benefit of this `README` is that I can tell you about
itâ€”non-code contributions are vital for modern open source!

In a nutshell: I created my first open source project in 1999, was
lucky enough to chair the O'Reilly Open Source Convention from some
years, led open source programs at Google for a while, and have been
involved in a variety of CNCF open source projects. You can find more
of my historical contributions at the bottom of this document.

### Some recent work

* In 2025 I joined the staff of GitHub, where I am part of the
  Technical Program Management leadership. I lead the team of
  TPMs focused on Copilot.

* Most recently at [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), I led open source
  ecosystem. As a company Sysdig contributes significantly to the
  [Falco](https://falco.org/) project, as well as maintaining other
  projects such as [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) and
  [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Here's [why you might want
  to work with
  me](https://medium.com/@edd/why-work-with-me-84e7e8b43f15)â€”though
  I'm no longer at Sysdig, you can find out about my management
  philosophy here.

* While at Google, I did a lot of working building the
  [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and
  [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org/) communities. When I became the
  leader of the 20 person open source program manager group at Google,
  my team also looked after engagement with
  projects like [Go](https://golang.org/),
  [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io/), [Istio](https://istio.io/) and
  [Knative](https://knative.dev), as well as Google Summer of Code
  and other amazing community endeavors.

### Interesting historical projects

If you've known for over ten years, you might not know [I changed my
name](https://medium.com/@edd/wilder-james-57a00bd8822d). Historic OSS
contributions all use my previous name.

* I created the [DOAP vocabulary](https://github.com/ewilderj/doap)
  for describing software projects. This went on to become the
  foundation for [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/).
* I was a Debian maintainer, principally looking after the Bluetooth
  integration
* I was a GNOME contributor, agains writing Bluetooth UI tools such as
  [PhoneManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/PhoneManager)
* In the mists of time
  ([1999...](https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/fc90293aaf6d8ef8fa1cd6152f6237c0bdfea4a7/doc/ChangeLog#L1614)),
  I created [PHP XML-RPC](http://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/)
