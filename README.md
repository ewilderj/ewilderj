My journey in open source started some time before GitHub, so you're unlikely to find too much in the contribution graphs. However, you may find the current information useful about my work in open source.

### Places to reach me

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edd)

### Some recent work

* Currently at [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), I lead open source ecosystem. As a company we contribute significantly to the [Falco](https://falco.org/) project, as well as maintaining other projects such as [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) and [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

* While at Google, I did a lot of working building the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org/) communities. When I became a manager at Google, my team also looked after engagement with projects like [Go](https://golang.org/), [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io/), [Istio](https://istio.io/) and [Knative](https://knative.dev).

### Interesting historical projects

* I created the [DOAP vocabulary](https://github.com/ewilderj/doap) for describing software projects. This went on to become the foundation for [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/).
* I was a Debian maintainer, principally looking after the Bluetooth integration
* I was a GNOME contributor, agains writing Bluetooth UI tools such as [PhoneManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/PhoneManager)
