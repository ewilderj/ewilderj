### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ewilderj/ewilderj** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...

My journey in open source started some time before GitHub, so you're unlikely to find too much in the contribution graphs as most of my coding stopped around ten years ago, and I contribute in other ways these days. The benefit of this `README` is that I can tell you about itâ€”non-code contributions are vital for modern open source!

### Some recent work

* Currently at [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), I lead open source ecosystem. As a company we contribute significantly to the [Falco](https://falco.org/) project, as well as maintaining other projects such as [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) and [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Here's [why you might want to work with me](https://medium.com/@edd/why-work-with-me-84e7e8b43f15).

* While at Google, I did a lot of working building the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org/) communities. When I became a manager at Google, my team also looked after engagement with projects like [Go](https://golang.org/), [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io/), [Istio](https://istio.io/) and [Knative](https://knative.dev).

### Interesting historical projects

If you've known me recently, you might not know [I changed my name](https://medium.com/@edd/wilder-james-57a00bd8822d). Historic OSS contributions all use my previous name.

* I created the [DOAP vocabulary](https://github.com/ewilderj/doap) for describing software projects. This went on to become the foundation for [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/).
* I was a Debian maintainer, principally looking after the Bluetooth integration
* I was a GNOME contributor, agains writing Bluetooth UI tools such as [PhoneManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/PhoneManager)
* In the mists of time ([1999...](https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/fc90293aaf6d8ef8fa1cd6152f6237c0bdfea4a7/doc/ChangeLog#L1614)), I created [PHP XML-RPC](http://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/)
